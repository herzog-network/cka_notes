# Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) notes

Just another place to store notes about the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam. There are already a lot of documentations, some are listed within [useful links](docs/00-useful-links.md). So, why to create a new one which will be propably outdated at some time? I learn more effectively when I take notes and start to visualize the information that I receive. That is the only reason why this repository exists. Feel free to suggest changes.

This repository state is work in progress until I got my certificate.
